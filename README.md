# straw: Extract data quickly from Juicebox via straw
Straw is a fast C++ implementation of reading/dump for .hic files.
 
It works by reading the .hic file, finding the appropriate matrix and slice
of data, and printing the text in sparse upper triangular format.

It is not as fully featured as the Juicebox command line tools Java version;
in particular, it doesn't store the pointer data for all the matrices, only
the one queried. It also doesn't currently support reading from a URL rather
than a local file. Future versions may look more like the Java implementation. 

Currently only supporting matrices (not vectors).

Must be compiled with the -lz flag to include the zlib.h library:
`g++ -lz -o straw straw.cpp`

Usage: `straw <NONE/VC/VC_SQRT/KR> <hicFile> <chr1>[:x1:x2] <chr2>[:y1:y2] <BP/FRAG> <binsize> `

## Python hook
Straw can be called from Python by using Boost <http://www.boost.org/>

The files [Jamroot](Jamroot), [straw.py](straw.py), and [straw-python.cpp](straw-python.cpp) are used for the hook. [straw-python.cpp](straw-python.cpp) is essentially the same as [straw.cpp](straw.cpp)

1. Get Boost:  
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_61_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html#get-boost
2. Compile bjam:  
  http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_49_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html#prepare-to-use-a-boost-library-binary
(just do --with-libraries python)
3. Type "bjam" in the directory with the files (assuming you've put boost and bjam in your path).
